                                    <h2 class="contentHeading">What is a Cryptocurrency?</h2>
                                    <p class="contentDisc">Cryptocurrencies are decentralised digital assets operating on blockchain technology. There are more than 5000 cryptocurrencies out there today, but Bitcoin was the first-ever cryptocurrency launched.</p>
                                    <h2 class="contentHeading">Is cryptocurrency legal in India?</h2>
                                    <p class="contentDisc">Cryptocurrencies are neither recognised by the Government as legal tender nor are they regulated by the RBI. However, there are no laws that prohibit (or allow) trading in crypto.</p>
                                    <h2 class="contentHeading">Is Cryptocurrency an investment or a currency?</h2>
                                    <p class="contentDisc">Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are digital currencies not backed by real assets or tangible securities. They are traded between consenting parties with no broker and tracked on digital ledgers. Due to the increasing value created by market forces, certain cryptocurrencies are perceived to be potential investments.</p>
                                    <h2 class="contentHeading">How can I buy cryptocurrency in India?</h2>
                                    <p class="contentDisc">To buy a cryptocurrency, you will have to deposit funds into an account. You can transfer this from your bank account to your wallet via UPI by clicking on the 'Funds' tab on Defy. With Defy, you can get started on your cryptocurrency investing journey with under Rs. 1000.</p>
                                    <h2 class="contentHeading">Can I buy cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin in India?</h2>
                                    <p class="contentDisc">Defy supports the purchase and sale of <number> cryptocurrencies. You can buy Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies using Defy.</p>
                                    <h2 class="contentHeading">What is cryptocurrency mining?</h2>
                                    <p class="contentDisc">Mining is the process by which new cryptocurrencies are entered into circulation; it is also the way that new transactions are confirmed by the network and a critical component of the maintenance and development of the blockchain ledger.</p>
                                    <h2 class="contentHeading">What is Blockchain?</h2>
                                    <p class="contentDisc">A blockchain is a database i.e. a collection of information that is stored electronically on a computer system. Information, or data, in databases is typically structured in a way that is decentralised so that everyone can access all the information from anywhere. This makes it tamper proof and distributes control over to everyone.</p>
                                    <h2 class="contentHeading">What is an exchange?</h2>
                                    <p class="contentDisc">When you want to buy or sell cryptocurrencies, you can’t just directly do it through your bank or an investing firm. Once you’ve decided you want to buy some Bitcoin, Ethereum, or another cryptocurrency, you’ll need to create an account on a crypto trading platform to exchange your INR for digital assets. This is done through an exchange.</p>
                                    <h2 class="contentHeading">What are Cryptocurrencies?</h2>
                                    <p class="contentDisc">Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies that are secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology—a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.</p>
                                    <h2 class="contentHeading">Why should I get involved with cryptocurrencies?</h2>
                                    <p class="contentDisc">A common reason to invest in cryptocurrency is the desire for a reliable, long-term store of value. Unlike fiat money, most cryptocurrencies have a limited supply, capped by mathematical algorithms. This makes it impossible for any political body or government agency to dilute their value through inflation.</p>
                                    <h2 class="contentHeading">How is the price of Cryptocurrency determined?</h2>
                                    <p class="contentDisc">The most effective way the price of a cryptocurrency coin is determined is by its demand. Heavy demand from buyers will push the value of a digital coin upwards. Conversely, if a coin has a high token supply with little demand, then its value will drop.</p>
                                    <h2 class="contentHeading">Where can I store my cryptocurrencies?</h2>
                                    <p class="contentDisc"></p>
                                    <h2 class="contentHeading">What is a wallet address?</h2>
                                    <p class="contentDisc">A Bitcoin wallet address is a digital address, made up of letters and numbers, that you use for sending and receiving Bitcoin transactions. In just the same way that an email address is used to send and receive emails, a Bitcoin wallet address is the digital address from which you send and receive BTC.</p>
